- Read a chapter or watch a video lecture on a specific data structure or algorithm.

2. Afternoon (2–3 hours):
- Study system design concepts and practice designing scalable systems.
- Work on implementing real-world projects to apply system design principles.

3. Evening (2–3 hours):
- Focus on competitive programming and participate in coding contests on platforms like Codeforces or Topcoder.
- Solve interview-specific questions to improve your problem-solving abilities.

4. Night (1–2 hours):
- Engage in behavioral interview preparation by practicing mock interviews or reviewing common behavioral questions.
- Read about the company’s culture and values to align yourself with their expectations.

Conclusion:
Preparing for FAANG interviews requires a well-rounded approach that covers technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and behavioral fit.
